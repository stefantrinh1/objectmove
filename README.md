## Summary

This was a play project while learning I decided to make. The program moves a selected item around the webpage to any location using arrow buttons or the arrows on the keyboard. it was program I thought might be useful in a application one day, so I saved it as a potential reusable code.

The project I deemed as a reuseable piece of code. Only a small amount of HTML, CSS was used to demostrate the functionality of the program. it is largely built on Javascript waiting for a click or a key action and then carrying out the movement on a selected element.
